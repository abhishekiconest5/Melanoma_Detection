# Project Name
   Melanoma detection using Deep Learning


## Table of Contents
*   To build a multiclass classification model using a custom CNN in TensorFlow.
*   To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
*   Technologies Used - Python tensorflow and keras
